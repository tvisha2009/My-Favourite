        <h3>
            <p>One of my favorite hobby is- Badminton. I have even joined an acadmey to learn it on a professional level. Its an indoor sport, and the reason I really like it is beacause that its an individual game, so you dont have to depend on anyone to win or lose. Its all on you. yes, there are duals but you aldo have single matches. This game was originated from India, another reason I love it!

        <h3>
            <p> Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. ... Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court. Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. </p>
        </h3>
        <h4>
            <p> All singles and doubles matches are the best-of-three games. The first side to 21 points wins a game. A point is scored on every serve and awarded to whichever side wins the rally. The winning side gets the next serve. If the score is 20-20, a side must win by two clear points to win the game. </p>
